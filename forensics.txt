which ls ps netstat find
ls -l $(which ls) $(which ps)

and got:

/usr/bin/ls
/usr/bin/ps
/usr/bin/find
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 142312 Apr  5  2024 /usr/bin/ls
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 146424 Mar 31  2024 /usr/bin/ps

you confirmed that the ls and ps binaries are in /usr/bin, and their permissions look normal. However, this doesn’t guarantee they’re clean—they could still be trojanized or hooked at runtime.

This is the most common rootkit method to force malicious .so libraries into every process:

bash
Αντιγραφή
Επεξεργασία
cat /etc/ld.so.preload

and got:
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.hook.so.6

We found /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.hook.so.6 in the /lib directory, which looks suspicious there.

Then , we just try to remove it through moving that file into /tmp:

mv /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.hook.so.6 /tmp

then trying ls again
and you get an ERROR: ld.so: object ‘/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.hook.so.6’ from /etc/ld.so.preload cannot be preloaded mean that we finally able to remove that kit .
so you ready to fin what ever you want:

find / -name flag.txt 2>/dev/null
